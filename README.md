# Homeworld
Household management application
<p>
This an app I've been using to experiment and develop skills. It's a fancy to-do app with an additional rewards tracking layer for completed tasks. The idea is to gameify household responsibilities. Sure, you could just use star stickers on a physical chart, but kids like tapping screens now, right?

It's a fairly standard MERN-based SPA. My goals are speed, platform independence, and minimizing distractions by making things like authentication as invisible as possible. Specifically, I want to keep the back end as light as possible by leaning heavily on client-side caching and localStorage. Under the hood, I've been experimenting with various React patterns such as hooks and wrapper components (it's all torn apart at the moment).

### Next steps for Homeworld
- Passwordless authentication
- Refactor the back end to run on MySQL, then PostgreSQL, then try out GraphQL
